Install SummerBoard (installer), reboot. 
Install AFPd (installer).
Connect to your iPhone via Finder: Go, Connect To Server, iPhone IP (listed in the AFPd GUI).
Login w/root -- default password is 'alpine' (unless you changed this, btw, change it!).
Mount 'Mobile's Home Directory'.
Move the extracted directories (from the theme) to Mobile's Home.../Library/SummerBoard/Themes
Find the theme in SummerBoard.

This worked on my phone w/1.1.4 - If you barely understand these instructions, don't risk it... you'll destroy your iPhone. Use at your own risk.

That said, enjoy :)]]></comment>
