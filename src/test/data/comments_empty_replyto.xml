I suppose that would be a violation of privacy, though. Maybe if it just integrated your Facebook profile with your OpenSocial profile...]]></comment>

If I fix my back/forward buttons, I lose middle and right--cilck, and vice-versa.]]></comment>

OpenOffice.org, although I use it as my primary office suite, is a steaming pile of crap when it comes to usability and UI design... the options dialog, for example, is terrible. Word's is also terrible, but not AS terrible. If you want a nice, quick word processor with a nice UI, try AbiWord... the problem with AbiWord, though, is that compared to OpenOffice.org, it's very underpowered and doesn't have some of the features I need.]]></comment>

However, if you're hoping to encode in h.264, this probably isn't the app for you, its options for h.264 are quite limited, and you'd be better off using the command line mencoder application. AcidRip and mencoder are both available in the Ubuntu repositories (not sure about any other OS's) so if you're on Ubuntu, just install it through Add/Remove or run the command < sudo aptitude installl acidrip >]]></comment>

This is true to some extent with incandescent bulbs, but the effect is much more pronounced in fluorescents.]]></comment>
