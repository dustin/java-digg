Like the saying says, "Outlaw guns, and only outlaws will have guns."  There's something else going on here - Canada and Switzerland (as shown in a recent digg post) both have high gun ownership and low violent crime rates.  Somehow that's not the case in the US.  The problem is NOT the guns, although I do agree with the idealists who say that no guns whatsoever would make the world better.  Too bad that's not even close to being an option, so we have to file that under crazy talk.  If we put our heads together we can figure out why people in this country are murdering each other... maybe we should try that before attempting some quixotic nonsense like banning guns altogether.]]></comment>

7 fifteen round magazines.
10 ten round magazines.

A 10 round limit, as in the 1994 AWB, would do little to deter someone like Cho.

If a large number of the native local population can barely feed themselves, what the hell makes you think they are out buying Xbox 360s or Core 2 Duo processors or digital cameras? (there is of course a brisk "pirated copy" economy for older platform games, etc)

Kirsten is supposed to be the girl next door, not a super model, and Toby is supposed to be sort of nerdy unable to get her (at first). Did you watch the movies at all?]]></comment>
